# GAN_mnist
<br> Coding a vanilla GAN from scratch in Tensorflow and testing it on mnist data. </br>
## Epoch -01

<br> Notice that the images are nothing but noise signals indifferentiable from each other </br>
## Epoch -10
![Noisy Image During 1st Epoch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ayushutkarsh/GAN_mnist/master/009.png)
<br> We see the noisy pictures taking take different forms after 10 epochs</br>
